# cut the rope
a shitty remake of the popular 2010 game of the popular mobile game **cut the fucking rope**

## why i created this shitty clone

## todo
- [x] making ropes more ropey
- [ ] actually making assets instead of drawing a bunch of squares and circles
- [ ] redesigning the shitty *candy owner* system
- [ ] decouple some logic
- [ ] actually work on the above instead of procrastinating
